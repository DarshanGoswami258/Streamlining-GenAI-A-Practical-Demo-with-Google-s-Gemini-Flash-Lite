 This streamlined GenAI application showcases the foundational workings of Generative AI using Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite model. 
 Built with google.generativeai and deployed via Streamlit, it offers a hands-on demonstration of how cutting-edge language models can be integrated into real-world interfaces for rapid prototyping 
 and experimentation.
